                        <p>When I was young I had this idea &quot;If I could learn how to learn fast, I could be anything. That could be my superpower.&quot;. So, naturally, I tried to acquire it. The journey of reading materials from Dominic O&apos;Brien, Derren Brown, Tim Ferriss, Josh Waitzkin and many more ensued. After learning a great deal I realised it&apos;s not that simple - there are a lot of constraints. It&apos;s not an Iron Man suit, but I still think of it as the most important meta skill you can develop.</p>
                        <p>One thing that you notice if you try to learn something is that you feel pain. Learning is painful. Why shouldn&apos;t it be? You want to be able to do a thing (e.g. play the piano, code in another programming language), but the current You needs to be left behind and morphed into someone who thinks slightly differently and is able to do that thing. Your brain is changing the neural composition of itself. No wonder it hurts, you are literally changing your being.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, we try try avoid pain. However, why do some people claim they love learning? Well, the process might be painful, but the results can be very rewarding. Specifically, if we are talking about small, incremental results. Which is, actually, a healthy way to approach learning. Set a bigger goal and break it down into smaller ones, so each small step gives the dopamine boost because your feedback loop is telling the bigger goal is coming. That is, actually, how good games are designed, so there&apos;s definitely something to it from the motivational perspective.</p>
                        <p>A lot of games are brilliant at engagement aspect. However, where do you get that motivation to learn skills that might not be as engaging as Skyrim or the next hit Battle Royale game? Personally, I love watching content from people who really love what they do and are masters at their craft. It doesn&apos;t even have to be the craft that you are interested in developing. The approach they take in the process and the care they give to the smallest detail. Then you see it all validated from the results they get. That&apos;s inspiring.</p>
                        <p>Self-reflection is a major part of learning. Essentially, it is self-correcting the behaviour you want a different outcome from or reinforcing the behaviour because the outcome was good. For instance, after eating a lot of sugary food I tend to feel tired and drowsy. Initially, it feel great, but after about 30-60min I get a crash. Now, it doesn&apos;t mean I have to stop eating sugary food, but it&apos;s not part of the diet on the day when I need to be at my peak doing a presentation or an important project, because I know it&apos;s not going to help.</p>
                        <p>If you spent any time learning about learning you will soon find a lot of articles about teaching as a way to learn. Basically, to become an effective learner you have to become an effective teacher. It goes hand in hand. Just think about it. When you are consciously telling yourself to do certain behaviours and avoid others - you are essentially teaching no other but yourself. It might seem quite magical how we learn (without much reflection), but this touches on quite practical aspect of learning to learn.</p>
                        <p>If you are able to explain a subject to a beginner and they actually understand it, it&apos;s clear feedback you understand the subject yourself. That&apos;s mostly applicable to conceptual knowledge though. Other skills, like fast typing, would give way better feedback using a tool designed to do so, like online typing test. It really depends on what you are doing, but feedback is essential to self-correcting and progress however you may get it.</p>
                        <p>People who are masters at their field usually are really good learners or learned their skills from people who are brilliant at learning. That brings us to one of the biggest constraints to learning that I constantly face - the right knowledge availability.</p>
                        <p>Internet has opened knowledge to almost everyone. There is more knowledge on the internet produced than you could absorb in a lifetime. However, finding the right knowledge for your goal is the next challenge you might face.</p>
                        <p>Tim Ferriss has written several books asking masters of their field how to become really good at their subject. A lot of that advice can work wonders in a very short period of time, because it&apos;s using the right knowledge for your goal.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the right knowledge is hard to come by and it&apos;s often hidden behind a premium wall. The good news is that more universities are unlocking that with online courses. The bad news it that you still have to be vigilant at where you invest your time in.</p>
                        <p>Another major constraint to learning which all of us face is forgetting. Some scientific papers claim it has a very important function and it helps us prioritise. Maybe so, however, there are some facts that I know I need to learn, but my memory system doesn&apos;t agree with me. What can I do about it? Well, turns out Hermann Ebbinghous could help us a little here. He reflected on this forgetting phenomenon, did an experiment, and produced a Forgetting Curve. Essentially, what the curve shows is we halve our memory of any newly learned material in a matter of days and weeks. Unless, we review it at spaced intervals just before we are about to forget.</p>
                        <p>One software that I use is called Anki SRS. You are able to make cards with questions and answers that take advantage of Ebbinhous&apos; Forgetting Curve. What it means is it shows the cards in a doubling intervals (1, 2, 4, 8, 16... days). It&apos;s very important to make cards that are very precise and has a quick answer. If your question takes more than 10 seconds to answer, break it down it smaller questions.</p>
                        <p>I consider learning to learn one of the most important meta skill to have and I constantly try to improve on it. It&apos;s not a superpower, but it&apos;s as close to one as I can get. Learning can be difficult. This is where self-reflection, teaching, keeping yourself motivated, and using any tools you have at your disposal really help you out to enjoy the process and love learning.</p>
